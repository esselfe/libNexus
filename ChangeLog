0.0.0.6: menuing working (still a bit buggy) :)
0.0.0.7: wrote editor mesh saving and loading from file :)
0.0.0.8: added selection box feature and plane adding function
	(the mesh loading is buggy with more than one plane in the mesh...)
0.0.0.9: fixed buggy mesh loading and wrote the multiple planed mesh handling
0.0.1.0 (09/05/11): major changes in mesh.c. Meshes now belong to a scene and scenes belong
	to worlds...
0.0.1.1 Rewrote some menuing, there is now a mode per floor (added 3 floor)
0.0.1.4 Wrote configuration file handling
0.0.1.5 Fixed incomplete mesh loading.
		Started writing mesh point hovering, still incomplete...
0.0.1.6 Changed the directory structure: put source code in 'src', 
		the building command becomes 'make -C src'.
0.0.1.7 Added usage of 'needRedraw' flag in the rendering function. 
		This way the CPU usage drops alot :).
0.0.1.8 Removed all dirty code
0.0.1.9 Some more cleanup... now using recursive makefiles, and oh, the most
		interesting: the program recompiles and restart itself by typing
		'rebuild' at the hud prompt :) And I introduced a new generic type,
		objects.h::struct Object. This way everything will be linked together.
		I also moved all header specific data type defs to Ntype.h. I want to
		keep this file sorted alphabetically by header provenance name.
0.0.2.4 Nexus CPU usage dropped from 100% to 6-20%. Also wrote handling code
		for the keyboard repeat state using the glutWindowStatusFunc() callback.
0.0.2.12 Yes I broke the keyboard repeat thing! (key repeat is off once Nexus
		quit. Using libsensors from its header instead of from system(). The 
		threading seems enlightned this way and updates the hud clock properly.
		oh and I screwed the usage, now uses 100%. The program now responds
		to process signals (SIGINT and SIGTERM). Wrote the selectID dynamic
		tree. Put the camera handling function as a thread.
0.0.3.0 Now gathering generic functions in libNexus so independant modules can
		use the lib. The Nexus program actually exploits this lib like any project
		would. (24/10/2009)
0.0.3.3 Trying to apply libNexus to some projects (testGame,inventory)
0.1.0 (23/12/14) Fix build on recent (2023) systems
