One idea about a Nexus concept (objectivity)

Every object in the program comes from a definition.
They all can be isolated for linked_info deployment on them,
which implies a lot of generacity among different object
manip handlers.

	Info about the object consists of a contextual_menu like
	set of choices available for that particular object.
	

	Enabling the mesh editor inserts new manipulations on the
	object's mesh.
	Enabling the text editor will add text manips.

The browser mode should (todo) handle objects like files, meshes,
messageBox, info menu, network packets...


Another idea: The selectID dynamic allocation.

Every objects has a selectID.
